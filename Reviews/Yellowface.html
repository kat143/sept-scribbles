                    technically a super high 4.85, but oml when i say i DEVOURED this kajfknasjf the way i was mad throughout the whole book because of june and was PRAYING FOR HER DOWNFALL, listen its because of the shtty things she did and the way shes trying to justify it like- anyway the only reason it's not a five is because of how it seemed random to me how [guy redacted] would just want to take revenge and justice for athena. plus everytime there was a ghost, i was TERRIFIED, like the whole prospect of it all scared me so badly and i thought this was just literary satire TT no one said anything about horror TT but yeah im making all my friends read this i love this book sm &lt;333333333333333
