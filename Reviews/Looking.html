                    This was a beautiful book about an issue still very prominent in 2022 American society, especially with the overturning of Roe v. Wade earlier this year. I learned a lot about the Canadian abortion movement and the history behind it, from figures like Dr. Morgentaler to forced adoption and maternity homes to the Jane Collective.
                    <br><br>
                    The story is chunked into three sections (pre-abortion movement, the legalization of abortion, and what constitutes as the modern-day result), but the stories and characters all connect together. I thought the weaving of stories was very well done; there was enough foreshadowing that you could reasonably guess what was going to happen, but still a sense of everything clicking into place when the connections were finally revealed.
                    <br><br>
                    It's a very thought-provoking read and really sticks with you. 10/10 would read again.
