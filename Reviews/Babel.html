                    DARK ACADEMIA MEETS ALTERNATIVE HISTORY MEETS FOUND FAMILY MEETS MAGIC ALL WRAPPED IN A STORY ABOUT DISCOVERING ONE’S IDENTITY?? COUNT. ME. IN.
                    <br><br>
                    Babel surpassed my expectations by a long shot—I’m usually not into in dark academia, and I thought I would be more into in the alternative history aspect. But the Royal Institute of Translation drew me in, and I was hooked. The fact that an institution could be so two-faced is not a new concept, but the fact that whatever was going on in the institute could very well have happened and still be happening in real life (using language and translation to gain and gatekeep power/knowledge, not the silver magic part) was part of the reason why I was so interested. The detail that Kuang went into to make sure the reader was truly immersed in the setting was much appreciated, especially the map + sketch of the tower at the beginning of the book (BRING BACK MAPS IN FANTASY NOVELS). Robin made for a fantastic narrator (who doesn’t love a good morally grey narrator) and reading through his character arc was fascinating. The way he grappled with his newfound privilege in a powerful, destructive empire and how he balanced that with his feelings about his background was a captivating shift as well as how it correlated his change from a sort of self-preservation-y mindset to sacrificing a lot for his beliefs.
                    <br><br>
                    Aside from Robin, the other characters were also incredibly well-developed and multifaceted. Rami, Letty, and Victoire all had their moments where I loved them and where I liked them less, but that only contributed to my appreciation for the way they were written—don’t get me wrong: characters you can unconditionally root for are amazing but characters that leave you thinking about their actions and motivations make for a more interesting story. The dynamic between the cohort was natural; friends can love each other and still fight and then just get over it. Even characters who proved to be “bad” at the end were still fascinating to read about, especially Professor Lovell. Robin’s conflicting thoughts about his supposed father mirrored his growth as a character well, and how he reacted during and after the murder showed just how deep that inner conflict was.
                    <br><br>
                    Those characters were perfectly suited for the amount of twists and turns the story took, from the Lovell murder to Letty’s betrayal. Those two plot points were particularly beautifully foreshadowed through Robin’s increasing displeasure at Professor Lovell’s actions and Letty’s continuous hesitation about the Hermes Society and its actions, respectively. None of the twists felt forced or abrupt; in my opinion, they were matters of “this will happen sooner or later” rather than “I didn’t see that coming!”
                    <br><br>
                    Aside from the storyline, the novel allowed me to look at translation from a whole new angle. I never thought about how it could be used and manipulated to cheat and steal; I had only seen it in literary contexts. The friction between translating in accordance to how a character’s superiors wanted and how they wanted to (and, by extension, the friction previously mentioned present in Robin’s views about his actions and how that fit into a larger context) was well-illustrated through his initial voyage to England as well as the later trip taken to smooth over opium-related tensions.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite books I’ve read in a long time. 10/5
